<h3>
the construction schedule
</h3>

<ol>
	<p>crust</p>
<li>Roll out half of the pie dough to fit a 9-inch pie dish (keep the remaining dough chilled). To prevent sticking, sprinkle flour on your work surface and rolling pin. Roll from the center outwards for even thickness, lifting and rotating the dough by a quarter turn as you go. Check the size by inverting the pie dish over the dough (it should be about 2 inches larger).</li>
<li>Carefully place the dough into the pie dish without stretching it, and trim the edges to within 1 inch of the dish. Refrigerate while you prepare your filling.</li>
<p> filling</p>
<li>Whisk the eggs and both sugars together until smooth. Add pumpkin puree, cream, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and salt. Whisk until well blended.</li>
<p>bake</p>
<li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (218°C). Set aside a large baking sheet.</li>
<li>Place the pie dish on your baking sheet. Pour the pumpkin filling into the pie shell.</li>
<li>Bake the pumpkin pie at 425°F (218°C) for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick or thin knife plunged it into the pie, about 2 inches from the edge, comes out clean. Rotate once or twice during baking. If, while the pie is baking, the top of the crust becomes too dark, cover it with a thin strip of aluminum foil.</li>
<li>Cool completely on a wire rack for 2 to 3 hours or until room temperature. Serve or refrigerate overnight (the pie sets even more after a night in the fridge).</li>
<li>Cut into eight wedges and serve alone or topped with whipped cream.</li>

</ol>


<h3>tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Storing: Since pumpkin pie has eggs and cream, we recommend storing it in the refrigerator unless you are serving it. It can sit out at room temperature for 2 hours. Homemade pumpkin pie will last in your refrigerator for up to three days. As a bonus, the texture of the filling improves after some time in the fridge.</li>
<li>Freezing pumpkin pie: Let it cool completely, then wrap it tightly in foil before freezing. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw frozen pumpkin pie overnight in the fridge.</li>
<li>How to tell when pumpkin pie is done: Take the pie out of the oven when the majority of the pie looks shiny and set on top. It should jiggle a little like jello, but not much more. The middle will still look wet on top. It will continue to cook as the pie cools on the counter. As a final test, grab a toothpick or thin knife, then plunge it into the pie, about 2 inches from the edge. If it comes out clean, the pie is done.</li>
</ul>
