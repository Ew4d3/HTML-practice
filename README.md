first time writing in html and css while at school. was tasked w/ creating a website for a recipie of our choice . 
this is due for sumbission on 17/09/24 and is not quite finished yet , (just needs a few refinements as i remebered about the unordered list tag i could use instead of using a paragraph tag and typing in the bullet points.) - this has now been since changed
